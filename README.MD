# Rust Websockets

I am using this repository to learn about the [websockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) protocol with Rust.

Currently, the client is built with Javascript and the server is built with Rust.

## Resources

Here is a list of some resources I am using:

- [Node.js websocket library](https://github.com/websockets/ws)
- [Tungstenite, a lightweight websockets crate for Rust](https://docs.rs/tungstenite/latest/tungstenite/)
- [Hussein Nasser's youtube playlist on websockets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Nt-ZrNP22A&list=PLQnljOFTspQUGjfGdg8UvL3D_K9ACL6Qh)
